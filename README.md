# Description

Deep learning is a powerful technique for microscope image classification. However, obtaining enough traditional microscope images to train a convoluatoinal neural network can be challenging. With the recent advancement in real time imaging with open platform image analysis capabilities (www.mt.com/EasyViewer), it is now possible to quickly generate a large collection of microscope quality images to train application specific neural networks. 

This page will serve as a "hello world" example for training a custom neural network with EasyViewer images, with sample code and generic images.
